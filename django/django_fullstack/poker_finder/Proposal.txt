I will be creating a poker game app.  Users will be able to search for poker tournaments or create a new game if they would like to host.  It will include what type of game is being played, location, buyin ammount, attendees and date and time of tournament.  They will first have to register or login, will then have access to their dashboard showing any tourneys that they are registered for.  The wireframe will be based off the iSport wireframe with the needed modifications.
